# Machine-Learning-Problems
Linear regression, Logistic regression, ANN &amp; CNN examples

This repository contains all the machine learning practice-problems that I have learnt as part of different online courses.

* Linear Regression : Solved exercise1 part1 of Andrew NG's Stanford Machine Learning course on coursera.
  * **Univariate linear regression** to predict the profit of the trucks based on the population of the city.
  * **Multivariate linear regression** to predict the price of the house given the house size and number of bedrooms.
* Logistic Regression : Solved exercise1 part2 of Andrew NG's Stanford Machine Learning course on coursera.
  * **Simple logistic regression** to predict the result of a student admission based on their marks in two exams.
  * **Regularized logistic regression** to predict if a microchip produced would be accepted/rejected based on its two test values. Since the data is **not linear** so I **created a bunch of polynomial features** to feed into the classifier to fit this non-linear data.
* ANN on gaussian distribution : Created random gaussian distribution data centered around three different point to serve as 3 different classes. I then trained a **Neural Network with cross entropy cost function using backpropagation algorithm**.
* Convolution examples : To get an understanding of how convolution can used to extract features, I used three basic filters to implement convolution over image and audio files,
  * Blurring of an image
  * Detecting horizontal and vertical edges of an image
  * Producing the echo of a music
